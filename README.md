Coconut Catcher:

Coconut catcher is a fun game where you catch coconuts in a basket and try to survive as long as possbile while setting a high score.


What does the game do?

You catch normal coconuts for 1 point.
You catch green apples for 2 points.
You catch golden coconuts for 5 points and they slow down the game a bit.
If you miss a normal coconut, the game ends.
Your highscore is saved even if you refresh the page.


How to get started:
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Click “Start Game” and use the left and right arrow keys to move the basket.
4. Try to catch coconuts, apples, and golden coconuts without missing!


How does it work?

The falling items are images moved down the screen using setInterval.
The basket is moved left and right using keyboard events.
If an item touches the basket, the score goes up.
A missed normal coconut ends the game.
Your score and high score are shown at the top.

Creator:

My name is Brady Zweben and I created this project for my AP computer science class. I came up with the idea becuase my orignial plan was to create a site that could tell you where the nearest coconut to a person was. However I gave up on that idea after I couldnt find a good algorithm for it. So instead I decided to make a skillfull challenging game but still on the theme of coconuts.
